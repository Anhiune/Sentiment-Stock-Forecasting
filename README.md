# 📈 Sentiment Analysis & Stock Price Forecasting

This project evaluates how sentiment data from social media and news impacts the accuracy of stock price prediction models.

## 💻 Tools & Libraries
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- BeautifulSoup, Tweepy, Requests
- VADER, TextBlob, HuggingFace Transformers
- XGBoost, Decision Trees, Linear Regression, ARIMA
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Granger Causality, KMeans Clustering

## 📊 Methodology
- Scraped Twitter/News sentiment data using Tweepy & BeautifulSoup
- Applied sentiment scoring with VADER, TextBlob, and BERT
- Built forecasting models: ARIMA, XGBoost, Linear Regression
- Compared models with and without sentiment input using MSE
- Visualized trends and prediction gaps

## 🔍 Key Findings
- Sentiment-enhanced models improved accuracy by %
- Lagged sentiment data showed significant predictive value (Granger Causality)
- Emotion spikes corresponded to abnormal price changes
- `scripts/` – Modular reusable Python code
- `data/` – Cleaned sample dataset (no sensitive content)
- `images/` – Visuals for documentation
